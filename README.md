- 👋 Hi, I’m @NewmanSaurusRex
- 👀 I’m interested in: making the world more accessible, learning, painting / drawing, equity / justice, learning all the things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: about collaborating on code w/git, hosting sites, and learning the workflow of a professional developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: dope beginner stuff to grow my knowledge / progress on this new coding journey.
